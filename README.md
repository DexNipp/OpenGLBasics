# OpenGLBasics

## Overview
OpenGLBasics is a personal project aimed at learning core concepts of OpenGL and graphics programming. The project focuses on understanding the fundamentals of OpenGL while also exploring the creation of APIs that interact with it.
This is a personal learning project, not a serious application. The project is statically linked to precompiled binaries of vendor libraries and uses no build system or package manager. You wont be able to build the project without having to do some work.
